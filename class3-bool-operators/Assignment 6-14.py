Requirements
-Comment your code
-use proper naming for your variables
-Include a string within your print built in function"""

# Set base and height values
Base = 20
Height = 15
# Establish the variable - Area_of_Triangle
Area_of_Triangle = (Base*Height)/2

# print(Area_of_Triangle) - Tested validity of variable

# String with variable built in
print("The Area of the Triangle is", Area_of_Triangle)
